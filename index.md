My name is Carrie Baker, and I am an experienced Clinical Psychologist working in private practice in Cambridge.

I offer psychological therapy for a wide range of difficulties, including anxiety and depression. Please see my
‘[Who is suitable?](suitable)’ page, or contact me in confidence to discuss suitability.

I accept self-referrals, as well as referrals from GPs and other health professionals. I am registered with Bupa,
AXA/PPP, Aviva, and WPA.

My favoured approach is Compassion Focused Therapy (CFT), and I also regularly use Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT)
and mindfulness in my work.

I also offer clinical supervision to qualified clinical psychologists.
