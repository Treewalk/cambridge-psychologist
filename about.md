Emotional well-being is important to all of us. As well as allowing us to lead satisfying and enjoyable lives, good 
psychological health has a positive impact on our physical well-being, and on the quality of our relationships with 
those around us.

As an experienced clinical psychologist, I am keen to help you understand yourself and your difficulties in more depth, 
so that you can make changes that will improve your psychological health and life satisfaction.

My favoured approach is Compassion Focused Therapy (CFT), which is particularly helpful for people who find themselves 
being very self-critical. I also use Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT), and incorporate other psychological approaches 
when it is clinically appropriate, including mindfulness, Positive Psychology and Acceptance and Commitment Therapy 
(ACT).

Having completed my clinical training in 1997, I chose to specialise in working with adults, which I have done mainly in 
the NHS. I have been working in private practice since 2012.

I enjoy working with adults of all ages, and I have been fortunate to work with people from many walks of life, with a 
wide range of backgrounds, and a great variety of psychological difficulties. I have worked locally at Addenbrooke's in 
Cambridge, St John's in Peterborough, and previously worked as the psychologist in community mental health teams in 
Salford and Tameside in the North West.
